# HOWTO write code

If you want to contribute, awesome!
Usual Github conventions apply: Fork, Change, Pull Request.

We try to leave tons of `//TODO` in the code, so search for them!

## Coding style

- We use Visual Studio 2013 (so that's the kind of solution you'll find).
- Formatting rules are pretty much VS defaults except we don't do brackets
  on new lines.
- No tabs.
- Soft 80 column limit, it's not an hard rule. Readability above all:
  if it looks bad in two short lines, don't bother.
- Any public API (from the library) must be documented.
  Comments on implementations are appreciated but not forced, although if you
  want to avoid having a long PR, just make a quick comment to explain what
  that `x` variable does.

## Issues and everything "non coding"

If you have questions/critics/suggestions on design/APIs, just open an issue!
