## What is this?

`TL;DR` IRC client in C#/WPF for Windows

Hi, We're people from #jacksoftszone and we're sick of OS X getting all the good
IRC clients, so we're making one for Windows.

Its current design is to have a IRC library written not be compliant the RFC specs,
but to survive even when in the worst IRC server made in human history
([Azzurra](https://github.com/azzurra/bahamut)'s being a big contestant for that title).

## Why don't you just go to good IRC servers?

Why don't people just stop using CSS? We're stuck with terrible, and I'm really sick of
having to use IRC clients who don't realize channel names are case insensitive.

## How do I sign up?
